This notebook does not contain the training code; just the results
The dataset for this research is taken from Deepglobe challenge which took place in CVPR 2018.Refer this link for more information:- http://deepglobe.org/
The training of the models is done using keras with the help of this awesome semantic segmentation repository :-https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models
